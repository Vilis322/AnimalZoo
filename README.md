# AnimalZoo (Avalonia + OOP Demo, .NET 9)

---

##  Project Description

**AnimalZoo** is a simple desktop application created for educational purposes.  
The goal is to practice **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles and build a GUI using **Avalonia UI**.
Each animal is an object with its own properties, behavior, and dynamic state transitions.

 ---

## ***Features***

- **OOP core**
    - `abstract class Animal { Name, Age; virtual Describe(); abstract MakeSound(); }`
    - Interfaces: `Flyable`, `ICrazyAction`.
    - Implementations: `Cat`, `Dog`, `Bird`, `Eagle`, `Bat`, `Lion`, `Penguin`, `Fox`, `Parrot`, `Monkey`, `Raccoon`, `Turtle`.
- **States / moods**
    - `Hungry → Happy → Sleeping/Gaming → Hungry` (auto-cycle via timers).
    - Flyable animals cannot fly while `Sleeping`, auto-land on sleep.
- **UI (Avalonia)**
    - Modern, colorful interface with proper spacing and responsive layout.
    - Left panel: list of animals with add/remove buttons.
    - Right panel: details of selected animal and interactive actions:
        - Make sound, Crazy action, Toggle fly (for flyable animals)
        - Feed with inline clear button
    - **Dynamic image** for selected animal based on its mood:
        - `Assets/<Type>/<mood>.png` (supports png/jpg/jpeg/gif/webp)
        - Flyable animals also support `flying.png` and `flying_<mood>.png`
    - Action **log** with localized messages that update when language changes.
    - Buttons use Grid layout to prevent overlapping in non-fullscreen mode.
- **Add animal dialog**
    - Reflection-based type discovery (no hardcoding).
    - Name + age + type; supports future animal classes out of the box.
- **Localization**
    - Built-in multilingual support with **3 languages**: English 🇬🇧, Russian 🇷🇺, Estonian 🇪🇪.
    - All UI labels, buttons, alerts, logs, and messages are localized.
    - **Dynamic log localization**: log messages automatically update when language changes.
    - Language can be changed at runtime via the **language dropdown** in the main window.
- **Database persistence**
    - **SQL Server 2022** database running in Docker for data persistence.
    - **ADO.NET-based repositories** with CRUD operations for animals and enclosures.
    - All animal data persists between application restarts.
    - Automatic fallback to in-memory storage if database is unavailable.
    - Docker management via **Makefile** commands or manual Docker/dotnet commands.
- **Pluggable logging**
    - Support for both **JSON** and **XML** log formats.
    - Thread-safe logging with automatic file persistence.
    - Logs are automatically flushed on application exit.
    - **Default location**: `bin/Debug/net9.0/logs/animalzoo.log` (or `animalzoo.json`)
    - Console output shows resolved log file path on startup.
    - Configure via `appsettings.json` (see Configuration section below).
- **Sound system**
    - Each animal has its own **voice.wav** stored under `Assets/<Animal>/`.
    - Pressing **Make Sound** plays the correct sound file for the selected animal.
    - Some animals also support additional effect sounds (e.g., **Dog** plays `crazy_action.wav` during crazy action).
- **Crazy actions**
    - Each animal can have unique "crazy" behavior, for example:
        - **Dog**: performs a multi-bark with a dedicated sound effect.
        - **Monkey**: swaps names between animals.
        - **Parrot**: mimics sounds of other animals; if no suitable targets are available, shows a localized alert.
    - All crazy actions are fully localized and logged.
- **Flight mechanics**
    - Any animal implementing `Flyable` can toggle between flying and grounded states.
    - Unified logic for all flying animals (no class-specific hardcoding).
    - Dynamic UI state updates and localized flight status display.
- **LINQ-based statistics**
    - Real-time table summarizing animal counts and average ages by type.
    - Separate lists for hungry animals and the oldest one.
    - Fully scrollable statistics panel with live updates.
- **Alerts and dialogs**
    - All alert windows use localized messages and button labels.
    - Centralized alert request mechanism integrated with ViewModel layer.

## **Configuration**

### Logging

The application uses pluggable logging that can be configured via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LoggerType": "Json",              // Options: "Json" or "Xml"
    "LogFilePath": "logs/animalzoo.log" // Relative or absolute path
  }
}
```

**Default behavior**:
- Log files are created in `bin/Debug/net9.0/logs/` directory
- File extension automatically matches logger type: `.log` for XML, `.json` for JSON
- The logs directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- On startup, the console displays the resolved log file path

**Log location**:
- When running via `dotnet run` or `make run`: `AnimalZoo.App/bin/Debug/net9.0/logs/`
- When running the built executable: `logs/` directory next to the executable

**Troubleshooting**:
- If log files don't appear, check the console output for the resolved path
- Ensure the application has write permissions to the log directory
- Logs are automatically flushed when the application exits
- To force immediate logging, trigger the application exit event

## **First Issue** (university task) -> CLOSED 
- Create three new animal types that inherit from Animal and optionally implement Flyable or ICrazyAction.
- Each class must:
  - Implement its own MakeSound() method.
  - Optionally override Describe().
  - Have at least one unique “crazy” action.
  - Provide corresponding images in Assets/<AnimalName>/. (optional)

## **Second Issue** (university task, issue is the same as the previous one) -> CLOSED
- Create three new animal types that inherit from Animal and optionally implement Flyable or ICrazyAction.
- Each class must:
    - Implement its own MakeSound() method.
    - Optionally override Describe().
    - Have at least one unique “crazy” action.
    - Provide corresponding images in Assets/<AnimalName>/. (optional)
